# MKS22X-FinalProject
Classic Tetris in Processing

[Day 0] 5/17/19:
  - Jawwad created the repo and began the Block class.
  
[Day 1] 5/18/19:
  - Kevin created the playing field, score, and line boxes (using the NES font, can update itself as normally text stays on screen).
  - Kevin created PShapes for all 7 tetrominoes (colored appropriately). 
  
  - Jawwad, after some experimenting with numbers, was able to create a double array of blocks centered on top of the playing field.
    - In the future, the piece lock feature will feed blocks into this array!
